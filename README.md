hsdProj
============================

A dashboard for presenting B.C. sub-provincial household estimates and projections, both number of households and average number of people per household, for development (economic) regions, regional districts (census divisions), and municipalities (census subdivisions).

Code is also provided for the data cleaning process.

### Data

Estimates: BC Stats releases annual household estimates for sub-provincial regions as of July 1st of every year. These estimates are calculated using a parametric model adjusted from Census data and the annual population estimates by BC Stats.

Projections: BC Stats applies the same parametric model used for the household estimates to the population projections produced annually by BC Stats to produce household projections. The projections are produced for every region type described above. More information can be found on [BC Statsâ€™ Household Projections page](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/population/household-projections).

The underlying data is available through the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-sub-provincial-household-estimates-and-projections-).

### Usage

The app.R code is used to create a shiny dashboard which is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://bcstats.shinyapps.io/hsdProjApp). Data are sourced and tidied in the get_data.R script. 

### Project Status

Stable
